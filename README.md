I was tasked with presenting data analysis on the Apple App Store. My Stakeholders are looking to create an app and want analysis on the current apple store on current well performing apps with good reviews. 
After uploading the Apple store apps and their description into my sqlite Database, I performed basic EDA before jumping into the Data Analysis.

I used https://sqliteonline.com/ to perform my Data Analysis with SQL

**Questions looking to answer**
1. Determine whether paid apps have higher ratings than free apps
2.  Check if apps with mopre supported languages have higher ratings
3.  Check genre with low ratings
4.  Check if there is correlation between the length of the app description and the user rating
5.  Check the top-rated apps for each genre

**ANALYSIS FINDINGS**
1. Paid apps have better ratings: This could be for a number of reasons. Paid apps may have higher engagement with perceived more value, leading to better ratings as opposed to their free counterparts
2. Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings: Our analysis found that ratings were higher with more supported languages.  
3. Catalogs, Finance and Book apps have low ratings: These categorys had lower user ratings. This could be for a number of reasons, but provides insight that there can possibly be opportunity in these genres. User needs are possibly not being met. 
4. Apps with a longer description have better ratings: Longer descriptions have a postive correlation with user ratings. It shows users appreciate having a clear undertanding about the app. 
5. A new app should aim for an average rating above 3.5 
6. Games and entertainment have high comepetiton: There is a very high volume of apps in these sectors. The barrier of entry is high.
